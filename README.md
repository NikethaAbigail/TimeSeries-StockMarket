## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to forecast stock prices using time series models. We use the Apple (AAPL) stock data from Yahoo Finance, explore its statistical characteristics, and compare the performance of different forecasting models.

## üìÅ Notebooks Summary

### üü¢ Notebook 1: Data Preprocessing and Visualization

- Loads historical stock data using `yfinance`
- Checks missing values and handles datetime formatting
- Plots stock closing prices
- Decomposes time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals
- Plots autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation to understand time lags

### üîµ Notebook 2: ARIMA and SARIMA Modeling

- Resamples daily data into monthly averages
- Applies differencing to make data stationary
- Builds:
  - ARIMA model
  - SARIMA model with seasonal components
- Forecasts future prices using both models
- Plots predictions vs actuals
- Calculates Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for model evaluation

### üü† Notebook 3: LSTM Forecasting

- Scales and normalizes the data using `MinMaxScaler`
- Creates time-series sequences for LSTM input
- Builds an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Trains the model on training data
- Makes future predictions and compares them with actual values
- Visualizes performance
